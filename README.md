## About Me

MSc Investment Management graduate with distinction, combining strong foundations in econometrics and statistical modeling, with proficiency in multiple languages/software/frameworks (see next section). My work includes ongoing formal research on oil price dynamics and AI adoption in UAE higher education, alongside independent interactive dashboard projects in options pricing and strategy visualisation hosted on Streamlit.

Professionally, I have worked as a *Crude Oil Market Research Analyst*, analysing global supply-demand dynamics, and provided regular insights on pricing structures, refinery outages, trade dynamics, and their implications on regional markets. I also investigated shadow fleet activity across key geopolitical regions of interest. 

I am currently focused on deepening my machine learning expertise and targeting graduate/trainee roles across the following verticals:

- Quantitative Investing
- Portfolio Analytics & Management
- Risk Analytics
- Systematic Trading
- Macro Strategy

For more information, please scroll through the page — my CV and academic recommendation letters are available at the bottom.

### Conceptual / Modelling 
- Data Pre-processing, EDA, Feature Engineering, Probability Distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson – PMF/PDF/CDF), Statistical Validation (t-tests 1- & 2-sided, chi-square, ANOVA, Tukey HSD, binomial tests), Time Series Modeling (ARIMA, VAR, VECM, GARCH), Econometric Causality (Cointegration, Granger causality, Impulse Response, FEVD), Machine Learning (Linear, Logistic Regression)

## Publications (Working Papers)
- "Exploring Short and Long Run Causal Relationships between Oil Prices, Macroeconomic Factors, and Uncertainty Measures (Working Title)" 
    - Co-Authoring a research paper with Dr. Athanasia Kalaitzi (Senior Lecturer Quantitative Finance and Economics at Middlesex University Dubai)
    - Focal point of the paper is investigating the transmission mechanisms uncertainty measures utilise to directly or indirectly affect oil price dynamics alongside other macroeconomic factors
- "Redefining Learning: AI and the Future of EdTech Innovation (Working Title)"
    - Co-Authoring a research paper with Dr. Monita Baruah (Associate Professor - MSc Financial Data Science Program at the University of Birmingham Dubai)
    - Focal point of the paper is to uncover key drivers of AI adoption across UAE universities using survey data that is analysed using a combination of supervised/unsupervised ML models to gather predictive insights and identify patterns in stakeholder responses.

## Completed Projects

*[Options Strategy Payoff Calculator](https://options-strategies-payoff-calculator.streamlit.app/)*
- Developed a robust web application that allows users to analyze a wide range of options trading strategies, including Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, Short Put, Bull Call Spread, Bear Put Spread, and more.
- Empowers users to easily input key parameters such as strike price, premium, and expiration prices. The application generates detailed net-payoff tables and dynamic graphs, aiding seasoned analysts and students alike in making informed decisions.
- Utilised popular libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and streamlit to create a user-friendly interface. This enhances strategy interpretation, providing valuable insights into payoffs and break-even points for various options strategies.

*[Options Pricing and Greeks Analysis](https://options-pricing-and-greeks.streamlit.app/)*
- Developed an options pricing tool using Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo methods, comparing options price sensitivity to volatility, time to expiration, and strike price, with visualisations of Monte Carlo price paths and distributions. 
- Implemented Greek analysis for both methods, and created multi-dimensional sensitivity plots for deeper insights into option pricing dynamics.

*[Pairs Trading Simulator](https://pairs-trader-sim.streamlit.app/)*
- Built a rudimentary pairs trading sim for an aluminium and lead asset pair with customisable parameters like z-score threshold, lookback period, lot sizes, stop loss, and take profit, enabling flexible strategy testing. 

*A VAR Analysis of the Nominal Broad US Dollar Index (NBUSDI), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), and S&P 500 (SPX)*
- Explored the impact of changes in the NBUSDI, DJI, and SPX on each other, aiming to understand the short-term interactions and causal dynamics among these key financial indicators.
- Identified robust autocorrelation in NBUSDI, suggesting enduring shocks influencing the index, while DJI and SPX exhibited limited immediate influence on NBUSDI, emphasising their relative independence.
- Granger causality tests revealed significant evidence that lagged variables collectively Granger-cause changes in NBUSDI, highlighting the importance of external factors and predictive relationships among financial variables.

*Assessing the impact of oil rents on UAE GDP: A multivariate time series regression analysis*
- A study exploring the impact of oil rents on the economic growth of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), focusing on the effectiveness of existing strategies.
- Addressed the model's limitations, including non-stationarity and multicollinearity, and proposed solutions such as the inclusion of new variables like 
merchandise imports to enhance model robustness and reliability.
- Found that oil rents significantly influence the UAE's economic growth, with a notable contribution to GDP despite government strategies aimed at diversification.

## On-going Projects
- 'Debunking Theories'
    - A repository containing Jupyter notebooks that dissect a particular financial theory or mathematical construct by examining its notation/derivation, practical use-cases, limitations & implications, while also providing an alternative solution for consideration.  
- 'Macro Dashboard'
    - An interactive dashboard that applies econometric techniques to analyse the interdependencies between key indicators. 
    - Insights are dynamically generated based on predefined template-driven interpretations aligned to detected patterns. 
    - Threshold conditions are systematically evaluated to determine breaches, ensuring that the appropriate insights are selected and delivered in response to significant economic shifts. 
- 'The Portfolio Trifecta'
    - An interactive dashboard allowing you to construct, analyse, and optimise your equity investments with great transaction, performance, risk, attribution, and simulation insights.

And more...
